This process is called positron-electron annihilation.\n\nAnswer #3: \"Two photons are released at 90 degrees to each other.\" : False\nThis answer is false because the photons are emitted in opposite directions, not at 90 degrees to each other.

We then apply a radiofrequency pulse to perturb the spins, and measure the signal that is emitted as the spins relax back to their original state.\n\nAnswer #1: \"along the frequency-encoding axis\": True.

The probability of a Compton interaction per unit mass is proportional to the atomic number of the atom involved.
