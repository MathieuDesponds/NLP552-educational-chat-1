    "Before starting to prompt, I watched a short course called \"ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers\" by Andrew Ng (https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/). In this course, the authors describe best practices for prompting. Here are a few key tactics:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tactic 1: Use delimiters to indicate distinct parts of the input\n",
    " - Delimiters can be anything, such as ```, \"\"\", < >, <tag> </tag>, or :.\n",
    "#### Tactic 2: Ask for structured output\n",
    " - Use custom or well-known structures (such as JSON or HTML).\n",
    "#### Tactic 3: Ask think step-by-step:\n",
    " - E.g. think step-by-step, Go step by step through all possible answers\n",
    "#### Tactic 4: Specify the steps required to complete a task\n",
    " - Write an accurate and clear step-by-step plan for the model to complete a task.\n"
